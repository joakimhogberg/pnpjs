## Current Status Overview

## v2 Contribution Guidance FAQ's

### How can I help out?
Thank You for your interest and willing spirit to contribute your personal time and effort. That is awesome and the success of projects like PnPjs is due to your willingness to contribute. If you would like to help out getting PnPjs v2 ready, please complete the following steps:
1. Review the list of [available v2 issues](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5B2.0.0%5D+sub+module+label%3A%22status%3A+help+wanted%22&utf8=%E2%9C%93) for the SP / GRAPH sub modules, marked with the _status: help wanted_ label. Each issue identifies the tasks needing to be completed for PnPjs v2.
2. After reviewing the list of [available v2 issues](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5B2.0.0%5D+sub+module+label%3A%22status%3A+help+wanted%22&utf8=%E2%9C%93), please select one of the issues you would like to work on, where you feel comfortable completing all listed tasks.
3. In the comments section for your selected issue, please submit a new comment with the following text: <BR>_"I would like to work on and complete the tasks for this sub module. @juliemturner @simonagren @PopWarner."_ <BR>This will send a message to [Julie Turner (@juliemturner)](https://github.com/juliemturner), [Simon Ågren (@simonagren)](https://github.com/simonagren) and [David Warner (@PopWarner)](https://github.com/PopWarner). One of them will then replace the _status: help wanted_ label with the _status: in progress_ label. They will then reply to your message, letting you know the issue status has been updated and the v2 sub module is ready for you to begin work. This will help avoid duplicate work effort by multiple community contributors on the same v2 sub module.
4. Fork the PnPjs repo into your GitHub account (if you have not already) and begin working on the v2 sub module tasks listed in your selected issue. Please ensure your work is being performed on the _dev-v2_ branch within your forked repo.
5. Once you have completed the list of tasks for your selected v2 sub module, please submit a single Pull Request with all changes.
  
### Can I complete just one or two of the checklist tasks in a “2.0.0 Sub-Module” issue and submit a partial Pull Request?
At this time, we are asking for contributors to complete all the tasks listed in an issue before submitting a Pull Request. Unfortunately, based on the current team size and availability, the work efforts needed to process and cross-reference partial Pull Requests to individual tasks for a single sub module exceeds the available capacity at this time.

### As I'm working on a “2.0.0 Sub-Module”, if I need some guidance (ex: How complex should my tests be?), is there another “2.0.0 Sub-Module” I can examine for reference?
Yes, please use the [[2.0.0] sub module: SP-webs](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/tree/dev-v2/packages/sp/src/webs) as an accurate form of guidance and reference.<BR>

### Is there any additional guidance for each of the tasks needing to be accomplished in each “2.0.0 Sub-Module”?
There was a PnPjs v2 community call for contributors. The call provided an informal overview and some examples & detailed guidance on the steps needed to complete a “2.0.0 Sub-Module”. The call is available on the PnP YouTube channel: ["Getting Started Helping with PnPjs v2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTUFVAegmvQ).

### Who can I reach out to with questions?
Please don't hesitate to reach out to [Julie Turner (@juliemturner)](https://github.com/juliemturner), [Simon Ågren (@simonagren)](https://github.com/simonagren) or [David Warner (@PopWarner)](https://github.com/PopWarner) with any questions on contributing. 

#### Thank you again for your interest in contributing to PnPjs!
